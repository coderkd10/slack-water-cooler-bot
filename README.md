# Slack Water Cooler Bot

## What ?

Slack bot to encourge people to have some informal water cooler conversations.

## Why ?

With covid going on we all are being forced to work from our homes. With modern collaboration tools like slack and zoom, WFH is almost as productive as working from an office space. Still it misses one key component - folks gathering around a water cooler and having informal (may be non-work, at times very random) discussions.

Though its very hard to replicate that in a virtual settings, this project is an attempt to solving that problem.

## How ?

Create a public slack channel, which all folks willing to have these water-cooler conversations join.  
This slackbot then pings this channel at random times (during work hours) with zoom links and some random conversation starter ideas.  
Hope is that if folks have some time to kill, they would hop on to that zoom call. The conversation starter would help with getting over the interia of not knowing what to talk about.
